= Fedora IoT Working Group Weekly Meeting	SOP
 
The Fedora IoT Working Group hosts a weekly meeting on Wednesdays at 1400UTC in the https://matrix.to/#/#meeting:fedoraproject.org[Fedora Meeting channel on Matrix]. See the https://calendar.fedoraproject.org/IoT/#_[IoT Working Group calendar] to find the next meeting. The following information is presented to show how to run an IoT WG meeting.

== IoT WG Meeting Outline

Fedora uses Meetbot for running text-based meetings from our Matrix meeting rooms. Meetbot recognizes several commands to start a logged meeting that will generate meeting minutes once the meeting ends. The following is an outline of the Meetbot commands executed sequentially that the meeting moderator would use to run a meeting:

----
!startmeeting Fedora IoT Working Group Meeting
!chair pwhalen coremodule miabbot

!topic 1) Roll Call
!topic 2) Working Group
!topic 3) Fedora XX - Stable
!topic 4) Fedora XX - Rawhide
!topic 5) General Bugs
!topic 6) Open Floor

!endmeeting
----
TIP: Since Fedora switched to using Matrix as our primary messaging system in late-2023, Meetbot no longer recognizes the !chair command. However, it can still be useful to !chair those who are integral to the meeting, as it will notify a user that they have been mentioned in a meeting, acting as a form of a ping.


== Meeting Invites
An invite to the meeting is sent out to the IoT email list one day before each meeting. If you would like this weekly reminder, you can subscribe to the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/iot.lists.fedoraproject.org/[IoT mailing list].


== Agenda
Each meeting follows a basic agenda as follows:
----
!topic 1) Roll Call
!topic 2) Working Group
!topic 3) Fedora XX - Stable
!topic 4) Fedora XX - Rawhide
!topic 5) General Bugs
!topic 6) Open Floor
----
If an additional topic is suggested, the meeting agenda will be amended accordingly to include it.

=== !topic 1) Roll Call
The Roll Call section of the meeting is usually the first ~5 minutes of a meeting, used to say hello and introduce any new meeting attendees.

=== !topic 2) Working Group
This is where Working Group issues are discussed. Usual examples are process changes and documentation updates.

=== !topic 3) Fedora XX - Stable
Any information pertaining to the current Stable release of Fedora is discussed here. Often, we review the results of the https://openqa.fedoraproject.org/[openQA automated testing] and look for any issues.

=== !topic 4) Fedora XX - Rawhide
Similarly to the Stable release topic, this is where we discuss general information pertinent to the current Fedora Rawhide release, including https://openqa.fedoraproject.org/[openQA automated testing results]. Once Fedora branches (and until the Final milestone is released), we change this topic to *Fedora XX - Branched*, and add a *Fedora XX - Rawhide* topic after this one, incrementing each topic following by one to reflect the additional topic.

=== !topic 5) General Bugs
Here is a place to discuss bugs that affect Fedora IoT as a whole, not specific to a particular release or milestone.

=== !topic 6) Open Floor
This topic serves to cover any other area that should be discussed, but doesn't necessarily fall under one of the previous topics.

== Meeting Minutes
After each meeting, Meetbot will compile text and HTML format logs and summary minutes. These minutes are then sent out to the https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/iot.lists.fedoraproject.org/[IoT mailing list], as well as compiled and stored https://lists.fedorahosted.org/archives/list/iot@lists.fedoraproject.org/[here]. It is useful to access the stored meeting minutes if you were unable to attend a meeting, but want a summary of what was discussed. The moderator of each meeting should review the previous meeting's minutes to bring up any !action items that should be discussed.

== Meetbot Commands

Curious what else Meetbot is capable of?
Below are the full commands you can use with Meetbot after a meeting has started.

* `!meetingname <a new name>`:
  Rename the meeting.
* `!topic <a topic name>`:
  Change the agenda topic of the meeting.
* `!endmeeting`:
  End the meeting and generate the meeting summary.

There are also several handy tags that you can use to tag a message to highlight it in the minutes (and add an emoji reaction here):

* üö© `!action`:
  An action item that needs follow-up.
  All action items will be listed separately in the meeting summary generated after the meeting ends.
* ‚úèÔ∏è `!info`:
  Information or details that summarize the discussion or context about the topic.
* üëç `!agreed`:
  A statement that the team has agreed to as a final decision.
* üëé `!rejected`:
  A statement that the team has rejected as an outcome or a decision.
* üí≠ `!idea`:
  A new idea or approach to a challenge or opportunity.
* üõü `!halp`:
  Help!
  Call attention for action items or work that needs help from other team members.
* üîó `!link`:
