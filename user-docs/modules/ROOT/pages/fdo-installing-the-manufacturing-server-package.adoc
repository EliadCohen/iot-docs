= Installing and running the manufacturing server

The `fdo-manufacturing-server` RPM package enables you to run the Manufacturing
Server component of the FDO protocol. It also stores other components, such as
the owner vouchers, the manufacturer keys, and information about the manufacturing
sessions. During the device installation, the Manufacturing server generates the
device credentials for the specific device, including its GUID, rendezvous
information and other metadata. Later on in the process, the device uses this
rendezvous information to contact the Rendezvous server.

To install the `manufacturing server` RPM package, complete the following steps:

.Procedure

. Install the `fdo-admin-cli` package:
+
----
# dnf install -y fdo-admin-cli
----

. Check if the `fdo-manufacturing-server` RPM package is installed:
+
----
$ rpm -qa | grep fdo-manufacturing-server --refresh
----

. Check if the files were correctly installed:
+
----
$ ls /usr/share/doc/fdo
----
+
You can see the following output:
+
----
manufacturing-server.yml
owner-onboarding-server.yml
rendezvous-info.yml
rendezvous-server.yml
serviceinfo-api-server.yml
----

. Optional: Check the content of each file, for example:
+
----
$ cat /usr/share/doc/fdo/manufacturing-server.yml
----

. Configure the Manufacturing server. You must provide the following information:

* The Manufacturing server URL
* The IP address or DNS name for the Rendezvous server
* The path to the keys and certificates you generated. See xref:fdo-generating-key-and-certificates.adoc[Generating key and certificates].
+
You can find an example of a Manufacturing server configuration file in the
`/usr/share/doc/fdo/manufacturing-server.yml` directory. The following is a
`manufacturing server.yml` example that is created and saved in the `/etc/fdo`
directory. It contains paths to the directories, certificates, keys that you
created, the Rendezvous server IP address and the default port.

. Start the Manufacturing server.
.. Check if the systemd unit file are in the server:
+
----
# systemctl list-unit-files | grep fdo | grep manufacturing
fdo-manufacturing-server.service disabled disabled
----

.. Enable and start the manufacturing server.
+
----
# systemctl enable --now fdo-manufacturing-server.service
----

.. Open the default ports in your firewall:
+
----
# firewall-cmd --add-port=8080/tcp --permanent
# systemctl restart firewalld
----

.. Ensure that the service is listening on the port 8080:
+
----
# ss -ltn
----

. Install Fedora IoT onto your system using the simplified installer. See xref:fdo-device-setup.adoc[Setting up a Device with FDO].
