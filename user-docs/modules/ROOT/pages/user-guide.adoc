= User Guide


Welcome to the user guide for Fedora IoT.
Both this guide and Fedora IoT images are in the very early stages, so please report any issues to https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/iot.lists.fedoraproject.org/[the mailing list].

== Supported Platforms

Fedora IoT supports the x86_64 and aarch64 architectures.

We have a page covering the currently tested xref:reference-platforms.adoc[Reference Platforms].
Other devices supported by Fedora on x86_64, aarch64 or ARMv7 should work just fine but haven't been widely tested in the IoT context so your milage may vary.

The list of supported reference devices will expand with time.
If you're a hardware vendor and would like to have a device become a reference platform by actively participating and testing Fedora IoT,
please reach out to https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Pbrobinson[Peter Robinson], the Fedora IoT Lead.

== Required resources

The images being created are currently 4GB in size.
The current memory used for testing is 1GB of RAM.
The Fedora IoT base image should run with less,
but of course this limits the amount of container applications can be run on top of the base OS.
