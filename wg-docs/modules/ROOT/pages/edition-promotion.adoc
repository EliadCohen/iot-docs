== Historical content

=== Phase one: MVP Edition launch (timeframe: July. Before Flock.)
* Items for IoT team to complete
** F-30 published on stable ostree repo
*** Currently on “devel” branch -- need F30 to be the stable one instead of F29
***  This is something Peter can do, but for F31 this should be integrated into proper QA & Rel-Eng process. Need procedures and to define clear roles.
** Clean up release process
** New ostrees and new ISOs
** Equivalent of two-week Atomic release process, but monthly
** Initial basic docs for release process
*** So that not everything is just in Peter’s head
** Update release criterial documentation
** Automatic updates enabled for F-30 release images
*** This is a change to ostree configuration to match CoreOS
** Update fedora-release-iot defaults and settings, add greenboot
*** PR from IoT team
*** Package owned by release engineering so CPE team expected to review and integrate PR
*** Review move to standard Fedora keys if ostree key rollover works
** Review of outstanding tickets for features/fixes

* Web site(s) updates
** New content for the IoT page
*** Content from IoT team
*** Design from ??? (will ask OSPO)
*** Integration work into new web system from CPE
*** Parity with existing iot.fedoraproject.org for automatic updates when new images come out with
** New content for front page presenting the edition
*** Any text from CPE team
*** Design to match existing front page
*** Update to front page from ???
** Redirect from iot.fedoraproject.org to new getfedora edition page

=== Phase two: Ideal target, Fedora 31 GA (October)
* ARMv7 supported images (actually aiming this for phase 1)
* Container pipeline for supported architectures
*** x86_64, ARMv7, aarch64
*** Current state: just x86_64, so we need ARM
**** Donated aarch64 hardware exists but is being used as koji builders
**** Note hardware was donated for this purpose

** Possible future: i686
** This is the big request for CPE
* IoT Toolbox container
** X86_64, ARMv7, aarch64
** This is an IoT team thing
* A number of containers for IoT demo use cases
** X86_64, ARMv7, aarch64
** Also handed by IoT team
* Publish “devel” image with toolbox container, and “production” image without toolbox
** This is a rel-eng change, but PT from IoT team, because we’re adding additional deliverables
